# VRUE Final Project "Pietroâ€™s Pronto Pizza"

### Game Loop
The idea is that two players work together in a pizzeria, with one player topping the pizzas with various ingredients and the second player acting as a waiter to deliver the pizza to the customers. When a new customer enters the pizzeria, a new order is displayed on the counter and the player topping the pizzas must finish them as quickly as possible. This player must then pass it over the counter to the second player to ensure interaction between the players. The restaurant area is much larger than the player's real space, so the player must move around using a locomotion technique. The aim of the game is to complete as many orders as possible within a certain time. Players receive points for correctly served pizzas and points are deducted for incorrectly served pizzas. If a customer has to wait too long for his pizza, he gets angry and leaves the restaurant, and the players receive no further points for this customer.
